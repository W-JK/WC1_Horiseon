## Project Lead and code refractor: Wojciech J. Koloska

## Project Description: 

Starter code refracting chalenge.
Compleeted as 1st Week Bootcamp Chalenge:
1) To complete a chalenge semantic structure and alt alemnts have to be implemented.
2) Index code and css was improved to follow right structure
3) Additionally to abowe clarity of the code was improved- index code and css was slimmed and divided into to clear visual sections.

In the future, when we progress with the course, I like to be able to add responsive section and viewpoint scalability - at least for mobile devices.
